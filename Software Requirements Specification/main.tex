	\section{Introduction}
		 The project is called \textit{Arcane Arcade}, which references the esoteric language users will have to use, as well as the gamification approach to try and make it as fun as possible.

	\section{Vision}
		The vision is to provide a fun and easily accessible platform that can be used to gauge the programming aptitude and capabilities of existing or future software developers using a custom esoteric programming language.

	\section{Background}
		There are many models in which to ascertain whether a prospective employee has the required skills or aptitude to be a valuable software developer. Online assessments are easy to execute, but lack the insight provided by manual and proprietary testing of how the candidate reasons. Manual and proprietary testing on the other hand is time-consuming and expensive to execute. In addition, company proprietary tests become stale and are leakined into the industry reducing the value tests may have.
		
		BBD has thus opted to use an esoteric programming language in order to test the skills and aptitude of prospective employees, regardless of their programming experience or preferred programming language. A mobile and online platform is thus required to test prospective employees while keeping the tests fun by using gamification principles. The tests should also indicate in which area the user is likely to be better suited, by looking at how the user completed the challenges, such as whether the user used any hints.
