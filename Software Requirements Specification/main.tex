	\section{Introduction}
		 The project is called \textit{Arcane Arcade}, which references the esoteric language users will have to use, as well as the gamification approach to try and make it as fun as possible.

	\section{Vision}
		The vision is to provide a fun and easily accessible platform that can be used to gauge the programming aptitude and capabilities of existing or future software developers using a custom esoteric programming language.

	\section{Background}
		There are many models in which to ascertain whether a prospective employee has the required skills or aptitude to be a valuable software developer. Online assessments are easy to execute, but lack the insight provided by manual and proprietary testing of how the candidate reasons. Manual and proprietary testing on the other hand is time-consuming and expensive to execute. In addition, company proprietary tests become stale and are leakined into the industry reducing the value tests may have.
		
		BBD has thus opted to use an esoteric programming language in order to test the skills and aptitude of prospective employees, regardless of their programming experience or preferred programming language. A mobile and online platform is thus required to test prospective employees while keeping the tests fun by using gamification principles. The tests should also indicate in which area the user is likely to be better suited, by looking at how the user completed the challenges, such as whether the user used any hints.

	\section{Architecture Requirements}
		\subsection{Access channel requirements}
			\paragraph\indent
			The system requires two interfaces:
			\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\leftmargin=1.5cm \itemindent=0em}
				\item Web interface
				\item Android app (Could also be a mobile website)
			\end{list}


		\subsection{Quality requirements}
			\paragraph\indent
							The following quality aspects needs to be addressed:
			\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\leftmargin=1.5cm \itemindent=0em}
				\item \textbf{Perfomance:} Performance is the most important quality requirement for this application. This requirement pertains to how fast the application responds to certain actions within a set time interval.The application will be compiler based and since compiler converts the program to native code of the target machine (object code), faster performance can be expected. 
				\item \textbf{Scalability:} The system will be used by mimmum of one administrator and the number of players (potential employees) is infinitely.
				\item \textbf{Security:} Passwords will be hashed with the SHA512 hashing algorithm.
				\item \textbf{Reliability:} An automatic partial dump backup can be done everyday at 00:00 and each back up will be kept for a week. On top of this a full dump will be done once a week and will be kept for at most 3 weeks. Alternatively the backup can be done by an external program. 
				\item \textbf{Audibility:} Every change should be logged and the person responsible for that log will be recorded. This will allow the administrators to track the users information/data.
				\item \textbf{Maintainability:} Maintainability is amongst the most important quality requirements for the application. Since the 					future of the application may require total change of the esolang developers should be able to easily
					and relatively quickly change aspects of the functionality the system provides or add new functionality to the system. 
				
			\end{list}

			
		\subsection{Integration requirements}

		\subsection{Architecture constraints}
			\subsubsection{Technologies}
			\begin{itemize}
		  \item HTML and JavaScript for the front end functionality for both the browser and game application
		  \item Java will be used for backend functionality.
		  \item PostgreSQL for persistence because it is a mature, efficient and reliable relational database
          implementation which is available across platforms and for which there is a large and very competent
         support community.
       \end{itemize}
