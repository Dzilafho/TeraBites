	\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{1.5cm}
	\item Our team is made up of individuals that are all studying towards different computer degrees.
We bring a unique perspective as we are able to give individual ideas on how to solve a
problem, and at the same time incorporate other member’s ideas to form an ideal solution to
any problem.
Our group understands each other and each person brings something different to the team.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item As
individuals we are strong in specific situations, together we are stronger in every situation
that will come our way.
For this project we have discussed that instead of using a divide and conquer method, we
will unite in completing each phase of this project as quickly as possible. This allows us to
ensure that we do not forget to implement a point that might have been overlooked as this
often occurs when a member works alone. It also guarantees that once a phase is
completed we do not move backwards only forward.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item We are all excited and prepared to
work hard and well on this project and we believe that you will be satisfied with the outcome.
We are more than prepared to research and learn about the fields
we currently lack. We would like to do this project because it is a unique and interesting
project that would allow us to expand our skill set and challenge us in a way that has not
been done before.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The UP Department of Computer Science recently prepared us for effective team work. I worked in a mini project were in  we had to deal with various constrains in groups. The challenges included differences in level of knowledge, interest, personalities and different types of pressures including time amongst others. From this I learnt how to work when under pressure and stepping out of my comfort zone and work with people whom I did not know.
		\item I have attended numerous workshops by Studietrust in which we were exposed to challenges and had to work in groups to resolve the provided problems. In order to solve the problems we had to combine the best of each group member. I can now effectively work well in groups even when the personalities of the group members are opposites.

\item As a young adult I am soon to be exposed to the world of properties. I will have to find a place of my own soon when I begin working and have to be fully responsible for myself. In order to effectively spend and manage money I need to know about risks and returns of property investment.

\item The project is very interesting because property investment is something I have no experience with but I am very interested in. The project arouses my curiosity and I find it intriguing to learn about it.

	\item 
		I studied a first year course in business management, statistics, and mathematics. And I feel with that with all these skills and knowledge that I have acquired from these courses, I can transfer all that knowledge into this project, with also all the programming skills.
	\item 
		I recently worked in a project at the university which introduced me to some extensive software development, which included working in teams, and working on different stages of software development (gathering and documenting requirements, designing, testing and so on).

	\item 
		With the skills that I have acquired throughout my tertiary years, I am confident that this project suits my skill set, but also it is the challenge of this project that I look foward to as it will bring a lot of experience on a personal level. With this being said, I am also confident that the project itself will be a success of the highest quality.

		\begin{itemize}
\item  We recently did a Mini Project where I was part of the team that was supposed to implement the backend functionality. I learned a lot of 
technologies that will be useful when doing this project, such as testing frameworks like Spring, building tools like Maven. We mostly used Java to implement and annotate entites for the mini project which were then persisted to the database using PostgreSQL, so I believe I know more than enough technologies to be able to finish this project with ease.

		\begin{itemize}
\item The main reason i want to do the project is because I like to learn new things and this is a totally new experience of development.  I am eager to learn and stay up to date with new innovations and IT related products. I am a
confidant, energetic young person, seeking an opportunity to expand my horizons. I don’t
mind putting in the extra effort and time, until the problem is solved, which also makes work
under pressure well.
\item I am able to adapt to different environments, and learn to use new technology, programs,
and programming languages well. I prefer to start working earlier than leaving it for last
minute; however I can work under pressure as well.I am a hardworking and dedicated student who loves a challenge and works well under
pressure.

		\begin{itemize}
\item We intend to follow the agile software engineering methodology as this minimises risk, promotes adaptive
planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and encourages rapid and flexible
response to change. Since the Agile Manifesto doesn’t provide concrete steps to follow we will use the scrum
methodology. The key concepts that we will be using from the methodology are involving the client in the
development process, continuous integration, paired programming, test driven development, design patterns and
code refactoring.

		\begin{itemize}
\item To keep you our client informed about the status of the project we have the following in mind. Since
you will be available for consultation twice in a month, we plan to have regular sprints of two to three
weeks and then have meetings with you to keep you up to date with our progress and hear if you have
any suggestions for us for the next meeting based on your impressions from the meeting.
\item  We will also
grant you access to the Git repository so that you can check at your leisure how far the development
is. Also with the Git repository we will also make use of the wiki page in GitHub to make the
checking up easy as this will act as our diary in the development process. We are also available via
Slack to have a group chat with the client if desired.
