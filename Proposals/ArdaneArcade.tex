	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{2.0cm}
	\item Our team is made up of individuals that are all studying towards different computer degrees.
We bring a unique perspective as we are able to give individual ideas on how to solve a
problem, and at the same time incorporate other member’s ideas to form an ideal solution to
any problem.
Our group understands each other and each person brings something different to the team.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item As
individuals we are strong in specific situations, together we are stronger in every situation
that will come our way.
For this project we have discussed that instead of using a divide and conquer method, we
will unite in completing each phase of this project as quickly as possible. This allows us to
ensure that we do not forget to implement a point that might have been overlooked as this
often occurs when a member works alone. It also guarantees that once a phase is
completed we do not move backwards only forward.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item We are all excited and prepared to
work hard and well on this project and we believe that you will be satisfied with the outcome.
We are more than prepared to research and learn about the fields
we currently lack. We would like to do this project because it is a unique and interesting
project that would allow us to expand our skill set and challenge us in a way that has not
been done before.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The UP Department of Computer Science recently prepared us for effective team work. I worked in a mini project were in  we had to deal with various constrains in groups. The challenges included differences in level of knowledge, interest, personalities and different types of pressures including time amongst others. From this I learnt how to work when under pressure and stepping out of my comfort zone and work with people whom I did not know.
		\item I have attended numerous workshops by Studietrust in which we were exposed to challenges and had to work in groups to resolve the provided problems. In order to solve the problems we had to combine the best of each group member. I can now effectively work well in groups even when the personalities of the group members are opposites.

\item As a young adult I am soon to be exposed to the world of properties. I will have to find a place of my own soon when I begin working and have to be fully responsible for myself. In order to effectively spend and manage money I need to know about risks and returns of property investment.

\item The project is very interesting because property investment is something I have no experience with but I am very interested in. The project arouses my curiosity and I find it intriguing to learn about it.

\item  We recently did a Mini Project where i was part of the team that was supposed to implement the backend functionality. I learned alot of 
technologies that will be usefull when doing this project, such as testing frameworks like Spring, building tools like maven. We mostly used java to implement and anotate entites for the mini project which were then persisted to the database using Posgresql so i believe i know more than enough technologies to be able to finish this project with ease.

\item  I am eager to learn and stay up to date with new innovations and IT related products. I am a
confidant, energetic young person, seeking an opportunity to expand my horizons. I don’t
mind putting in the extra effort and time, until the problem is solved, which also makes work
under pressure well.I am able to adapt to different environments, and learn to use new technology, programs,
and programming languages well. I prefer to start working earlier than leaving it for last
minute; however I can work under pressure as well.I am a hardworking and dedicated student who loves a challenge and works well under
pressure.

\item Our Git repository will be accessible to so that you can check
at your leisure the progress of the development. Alongside the Git
repository we will also make use of the wiki page in GitHub to make
the checking up easy as this will act as our diary in the development
process. The whole group is also available via Slack to have a group
chat with the client if desired.
