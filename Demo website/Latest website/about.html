					Formed by three dynamic developers back in 1984, BBD now employs more than 550 software developers, system architects, application designers, digital strategists and tech-trend enthusiasts. Although our HQ is based in Johannesburg, we can 
					also be found in Pretoria and Cape Town, and in Bulgaria and India too. In addition to our core software and application development services, we have a dedicated, in-house research and development team that provides constant training, insight and guidance on 
					the latest technology trends, tools and frameworks.
					</p>
					<p>
					Whether your business merely needs some new module added to your existing software architecture, an up-to-the-minute IT systems update, or a brand new, responsive application built from the ground up, we have the technical experience and the developer 
					expertise to design custom software solutions for any situation. We work with you to define each system&#39;s exact objectives, and provide you with ongoing, personal feedback about the development of your software solution- so you&#39;ll be able to confidently report 
					back to your team about your project&#39;s positive progress. You&#39;ll also get wicked code-cred, guaranteed.
